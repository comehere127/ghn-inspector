## üñ•Ô∏è Developing

Ensure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 14 or later installed
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) v1 or v2 installed

Then run the following:

- `yarn install` to install dependencies.
- `yarn run dev:chrome` to start the development server for chrome extension
- `yarn run dev:firefox` to start the development server for firefox addon
- `yarn run build:chrome` to build chrome extension
- `yarn run build:firefox` to build firefox addon
- `yarn run build` builds and packs extensions all at once to `extension/` directory

### Test in Dev Mode

1. `yarn install` to install dependencies.
2. `yarn run dev:chrome` or `yarn run dev:firefox` To watch file changes in development
3. Load the extension in your browser

    _NOTE: Remove any existing versions first_

   #### Chrome

    - Go to the browser address bar and type `chrome://extensions`.
    - Check the `Developer Mode` button to enable it.
    - Click on the `Load Unpacked Extension‚Ä¶` button.
    - Select the folder `inspector/extension/chrome`.

   #### Firefox [ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/enterprise/), [Developer](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/), or [Nightly build](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly)

    - Go to the browser address bar and type `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
    - Click on the `Temporary Extensions` Section, then the `Load Unpacked Extension‚Ä¶` button.
    - Select the file `inspector/extension/firefox.xpi`.

### Test Prod builds

- `yarn run build` builds the extension for all the browsers.

Note: By default the `package.json` and `manifest.json` are set with version `0.0.0`. The CI pipeline will set the version before building the bundles.

### Generating browser specific manifest.json

Update `source/manifest.json` file with browser vendor prefixed manifest keys

```js
{
  "__chrome__name": "SuperChrome",
  "__firefox__name": "SuperFox",
  "__edge__name": "SuperEdge",
  "__opera__name": "SuperOpera"
}
```

if the vendor is `chrome` this compiles to:

```js
{
  "name": "SuperChrome",
}
```

Add keys to multiple vendors by separating them with | in the prefix

```
{
  __chrome|opera__name: "SuperBlink"
}
```

if the vendor is `chrome` or `opera`, this compiles to:

```
{
  "name": "SuperBlink"
}
```
